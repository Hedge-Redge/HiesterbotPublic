Leader of a paramilitary group that would do his bidding--including kill--to ensure favorable election results. Gov of SC from 1890 until his appointment to the US Senate (1895-1918). Campaigned as a populist, but helped push through a new state constitution that disenfranchised many of the poor white citizens that supported him, even as it disenfranchise just about all of the black citizens. Ran for president in 1896, but his speech at the convention was so radical and aggressive that he lost his original support. While his social conservatism saw him supporting lynch mobs and opposing women's suffrage, he was a progressive when it came to federal campaign finance laws, higher education, and business regulations. Supported World War I to fight the German \"slaves.\" Got in a fist fight in the US Senate at one point. Suggested a thousand blacks should be killed so they'd \"learn their place\" after Pres.

His advocacy of Popular Sovereignty (states deciding slavery on their own) was popular among the party but it also helped lead to Bleeding Kansas. Detested by James Buchanan who used more energy trying to hurt his nterparty rival Douglas than he did trying to avert Civil War. Faced Lincoln in the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates, but defeated Lincoln for reelection to the US Senate. However, Lincoln's effective debating and Buchanan's manipulations hurt Douglas as an 1860 candidate, which helped result in a split in the Democrats as Douglas was now opposed by both anti-slavery and pro-slavery Democrats. Buchananites generally voted for Southern Democrat Breckinridge. Douglas, to his credit, campaigned mostly on preserving the Union than trying to win the election against his rival Lincoln. Douglas died a few months after Lincoln's inauguration of typhoid but not before doing much to ensure Lincoln had the support of Union Democrats.

Gov of GA (1931-1933) and Sen of GA (1933-1971). The Russell Senate Office Building is named after him, but it seems a likely candidate for a name change.

Co-author of the Federalist Papers. Architect of the Jeffersonian Republican Party. Secretly wrote one of the 1798 Resolutions opposing the Alien & Sedition Acts. Sec of State fo Jefferson for two terms. Had some tension running for office in his political career as many Virginians favored the more conservative Monroe to the more moderate Madison. He presidency started slow and the War of 1812 almost proved a disaster and made reelection a close race. The war taught Madison that many Federalist policies were necessary and so he moderated. Following the war, the Era of Good Feelings was inagurated and the adoption of Federalist policies was one of many factors that slowly killed off the Federalist opposition.

Booed off the stage by conservatives in 1964 when he called for a moderate platform. Ran again in 1968 but didn't put his heart into it. Pres. Ford made Rockefeller his VP in 1974 to help with domestic policy but Ford's Chief of Staff, Donald Rumsfeld, thwarted Rockefeller's efforts.

He campaigned actively for Goldwater and other GOPers in 1964, which resurrected his career. Prior to death, advised Pres. Clinton on foreign policy occasionally.

This caused controversy but RFK proved effective and courageous, such as when he combated the mafia. Was combative, a work-a-holic, and perfectionist to a fault that frequently alienated people, such as LBJ, Gore Vidal, and others. For this reason, he may have faced problems Jimmy Carter faced when working with politicians, even in his own party. Following his brother's assassination, he stayed on as Attorney General until winning election as US Senator from NY. Challenged LBJ for the nomination in 1968 but not before Eugene McCarthy jumped in first. RFK was arguably on the trajectory for victory before his own assassination at age 42, but Humphrey might have won at the Convention under the old rules anyway.

By 1950, McCarthy was seen as the most vocal anti-Communist and his accusations became wilder and more controversial as he gained more attention. So influential was he on voters that Republicans such as Eisenhower campaigned with him and were reluctant to condemn him. In fact his ties to the Catholic community were so strong that the Kennedys, who had been friends with him, would not condemn him even though he was of the opposing party. Fellow Sen. Margaret Chase Smith was the first to oppose McCarthy's politics in the US Senate and others soon followed, resulting in an overwhelming vote of \"condemnation\" against him. The only Democrat that didn't vote in the censure was JFK, who was recovering from back surgery. Following censure, McCarthy's influence dwindled and he sunk into depression and alcoholism. His lawyer, Roy Cohn, was also a lawyer and a kind of mentor for a young Donald Trump. McCarthy's 4-year reign of terror as the leading anti-Communist is so strong a part of the Cold War narrative as to make it seem as if he had been in power for decades.

Republicans converted him, hoping to make use of his celebrity status as an explorer. At the start of the Civil War, Seward objected to Lincoln's idea of making Fremont minister to France because he was too radical. Therefore, Lincoln made him a general in the Union army and placed him in charge of the Western Department. Lincoln removed him from the position after Fremont unilaterally put Missouri under martial law and emancipated slavery in the state. Overall, Fremont proved to be a poor administrator and a poor general, even if his heart was in the right place. In 1864, the Radical Democracy Party, which believed Lincoln was moving to slow in abolishing slavery, nominated Fremont for president. However, he disbanded the party and his campaign once Lincoln agreed to remove conservative Republican Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General, the office which gave out the majority of federal jobs nationally.
